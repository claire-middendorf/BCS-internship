SQL for internship project
My SQL code is separated into four folders within the budget folder: "sql_ddl", "sql", "pattern_files", and "notes". 
The "sql_ddl" folder includes the data table from which I can draw data from with SQL code to find patterns. 
The "sql" folder includes the code for creating a table organizing the patterns I found, including some other files with code where I find different patterns within the data table.
The "pattern_files" folder includes the final draft of code for the patterns I found within the data table. 
The "notes" folder is filled wih my progression of analysis code and finding patterns in the table. It also includes some summaries of my work throughout the process.
